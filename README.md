## features
- 9 keys
- OLED display
- 16 RGB LEDs, intended as system monitors
- PCB-mount style, no top plate
- optional USB port for daisy chaining keyboards

## cad
The CAD is in an Onshape document available [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/859a6718b395782d916274d9/w/acb2d55d003e03c3719d4ca6/e/6f143904c3132775702816f5?renderMode=0&uiState=6834dff6784e7633979328d8).

## a note on the custom firmware
because i want to use the RGB LEDs to monitor system load, i had to write custom firmware, because neither qmk nor kmk supports getting info from the host like that.

## a note on the usb port
the USB port is optional. it's intended to forward HID packets from a second keyboard using pico-pio-usb. because this would require even more custom firmware, i don't plan to do it immediately but did break out the required pins on the PCB.
