## features
- 9 keys
- OLED display
- 16 RGB LEDs, intended as system monitors
- PCB-mount style, no top plate
- optional USB port for daisy chaining keyboards

## a note on the custom firmware
because i want to use the RGB LEDs to monitor system load, i had to write custom firmware, because neither qmk nor kmk supports getting info from the host like that.

## a note on the usb port
the USB port is optional. it's intended to forward HID packets from a second keyboard using pico-pio-usb. because this would require even more custom firmware, i don't plan to do it immediately but did break out the required pins on the PCB.
